# Information

This code was developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis and has not been extensively tested or optimized for ease of use. However, it can provide some important insights into the approach taken and allow inspection of the created Deep Learning PV forecasting model as well as its various modifications.

For best viewing of the notebooks, it is recommended to use a code editor such as Google Colab or VSCode.
